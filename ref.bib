abstract = {As the discipline of K-12 computer science (CS) education evolves, international comparisons of curriculum and teaching provide valuable information for policymakers and educators. Previous academic analyses of K-12 CS intended and enacted curriculum has been conducted via curriculum analyses, country reports, experience reports, and case studies, with K-12 CS comparisons distinctly lacking teacher input.This report presents the process of an international Working Group to develop, pilot, review and test validity and reliability of the MEasuring TeacheR Enacted Computing Curriculum (METRECC) instrument to survey teachers in K-12 schools about their implementation of CS curriculum to understand pedagogy, practice, resources and experiences in classrooms around the world. The Working Group reviewed and analysed pilot data from 244 teachers across seven countries (Australia, England, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Scotland and the United States). We analysed the pilot results (n=244) and applied four validity tests: face validity, concurrent validity, population validity, sampling validity and construct validity, in addition to a focus group to further revised the instrument.This report presents the pilot results and outcomes of validity testing, as well as revisions made to the instrument. The resulting METRECC tool combines a country report template and a teacher survey that will provide K-12 teachers with a means to communicate their experience enacting CS curriculum. National and regional policymakers can use METRECC data to inform iterative curriculum revision and implementation. We provide open access to the METRECC instrument and data set.},

abstract = {With the rise of Computational Thinking (CT) instruction at the elementary level, it is imperative for elementary computing instruction to support a variety of learners. TIPP&amp;SEE is a meta-cognitive learning strategy that scaffolds student learning when learning from example code. Results from a previous study show statistically-significant performance differences favoring students using the TIPP&amp;SEE strategy on a written assessment. In this work, our goal is gain insight as to it why such dramatic learning differences may have occurred. We analyze the students' computational artifacts and TIPP&amp;SEE worksheets. Artifact analysis reveals that students in the TIPP&amp;SEE group are more thorough in their work, completing more elements of the required tasks. In addition, they build open-ended projects with longer scripts that utilize more learned blocks. Worksheet analysis shows that students were highly accurate on some types of questions but largely skipped others. Despite these positive behaviors, there was little statistical correlation between student worksheet correctness, project completion, and written assessment performance. Therefore, while students in the TIPP&amp;SEE group performed actions we believe lead to more success, no individual actions directly explain the results. Like other meta-cognitive strategies, the value of TIPP&amp;SEE may lie in cognitive processes not directly observable, and may vary based upon individual student differences.},
